   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up Supabase**
   - Create a new Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Run the migration files in `supabase/migrations/` to set up your database schema
   - Copy your Supabase URL and anon key

4. **Configure environment variables**
   - Update `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` with your Supabase credentials:
     ```typescript
     const SUPABASE_URL = "your-supabase-url";
     const SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = "your-supabase-anon-key";
     ```

5. **Run the development server**

## 🗄️ Database Schema

The application uses the following main tables:
- `profiles` - User profile information
- `user_progress` - XP, level, and streak tracking
- `lesson_progress` - Lesson completion status
- `quiz_scores` - Quiz results and performance
- `flashcard_progress` - Spaced repetition algorithm data
- `user_learned_signs` - Tracks which signs users have learned
- `achievements` - User achievement badges
- `road_signs` - Catalog of Japanese road signs

All tables have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled to ensure users can only access their own data.

## 🎯 Key Features Explained

### Gamification System
- **XP Calculation**: Users earn XP for completing activities (lessons: 100-300 XP, quizzes: 50-500 XP)
- **Leveling**: Level = `floor(total_xp / 1000) + 1`
- **Streak System**: Tracks consecutive days of activity, resets if a day is missed
- **Achievements**: Automatically awarded for milestones (streaks, levels, sign mastery)

### Spaced Repetition
The flashcard system uses the SM-2 algorithm to optimize review intervals:
- Tracks ease factor, interval, and repetitions per card
- Calculates due dates based on user performance
- Helps with long-term retention of sign meanings

### Security
- All database tables use Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only view/modify their own data
- Authentication handled securely by Supabase
- Database triggers automatically create user profiles on signup
